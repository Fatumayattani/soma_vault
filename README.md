# Somavault
Somavault is designed to tackle the challenge of limited access to quality educational resources, particularly in underdeveloped regions, with a specific focus on Africa. The project aims to provide a platform that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to generate tailored educational content, ensuring that students and teachers in low-resource areas have access to learning materials that meet their specific needs.
