# Somavault
Somavault is designed to tackle the challenge of limited access to quality educational resources, particularly in underdeveloped regions, with a specific focus on Africa. The project aims to provide a platform that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to generate tailored educational content, ensuring that students and teachers in low-resource areas have access to learning materials that meet their specific needs.
This platform will help bridge the gap in educational resource availability by providing localized, relevant, and easily accessible content for various subjects, grade levels, and languages.

## Problem Statement

In many parts of Africa and other underdeveloped regions, there is a lack of access to quality education and teaching resources. Traditional education systems face challenges such as limited availability of textbooks, teachers, and learning materials. This situation hampers the potential for self-learning and effective teaching, especially in rural or resource-poor areas.
